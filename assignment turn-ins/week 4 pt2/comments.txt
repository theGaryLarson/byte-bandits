LOAD is not working on my system. I tried to troubleshoot. I found i am supposed to change the permissions in my.ini file but the file does not exist.

After our discussion our idea was to load all the data into one table. Which is reflected in our schema with the bendover_data_feed table.
However, we cannot even get it to add the data because of the below error.

Here is the error we are receiving:

19:23:03	LOAD DATA INFILE 'csv/clean_bendover_data_feed.csv' INTO TABLE `targeted_marketing`.`bendover_data_feed` FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS	Error Code: 1290. The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement	0.000 sec
