AD350 group project. Repo created for sharing and merging scripts. Don't worry about breaking it. I know enough where we can rollback to previous commits.
But if you want to play around and learn to use git in a collaborative way I suggest creating a branch then doing a pull request to merge changes.

### Keep in mind for it to merge you have to make your changes in the original file so it knows to compare them.
